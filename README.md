## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript

### Continued development

This project is nearly complete, although I have some issues with submitting inputs due to how my forms are set up. There are a few minor issues in terms of visibility and active states that I am aware of, and I plan to iron out these issues in the coming days.
